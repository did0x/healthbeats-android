# HealthBeats
HealthBeats gave a project task to determine the skill test that I mastered for the initial selection process.

## Instructions
To run this project you need **Android Studio**, the Android Studio will help you to build the APK and run the application.

1. Clone this project or simply you can download it as a .zip
2. If the project is already cloned and extracted, open the Android Studio and then choose **Open**
3. The dialog windows will show up, and please select the project folder you have saved
4. The first time project opened, it will take some time, so you need patient
5. Run-on the emulator or physical device as you want

## Architecture 
On this project I choosed to use MVC architecture because this project were a small project. It no need the Network Service to request an APIs. 
The data is still localed too. If I use the MVVM project, I was thinking that it will be overkill.

## Improvement
And I've been thinking to improve this project by doing some stuff like,
- **Complete Other Menus**
- **Add the AlarmManager to Show Notification**
- **Make the App More Smoothly**
